THE SMALLEST WORD PROCESSOR IN THE WORLD (MAYBE)
*******************************************************************************

It's a word processor, which weighs only 199 bytes.
For obvious reasons it is not something very complex or with many functions, in fact, you can only write text. And that's it.

I did this in 5 minutes in Batch, a language that hardly anyone uses these days, but it's very lightweight, and that's why I was able to do this without going over 200 bytes (Almost, but no).

NOTE: Do not put only the name of your file, also put the extension (Not mytext, it is mytext.txt or any other format).

(You could technically write code on this, but I don't recommend it.).
